# Chicory demos

In this repository you can find a few examples using [Chicory](https://github.com/dylibso/chicory).

There are 3 folders:

- `compile_to_wasm` is basic setup to show how to compile a Rust program to WASM
- `dynamic-loading` shows how to embed the Chicory engine in a Java program leveraging [jbang](https://www.jbang.dev/)
- `quarkus` shows how to use Chicory in a [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) server application

You will find the instructions on how to run the examples in the relevant directory and the rest of the writeup in the blog.
